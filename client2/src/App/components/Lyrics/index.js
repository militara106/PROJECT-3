  Verso
  Ey dime qué esperas
  Baby te quiero pero afuera
  Ere alguien por dentro y otra por fuera
  Y ya no siento nada cuando te encuera
  Dame-dame banda eh
  En mi corazón ya tú no ere la que manda
  Se acabó por ti ya no siento nada
  De nuestra serie ya no salen temporada
  Así que vete lejo dile al diablo que te envíe el pin
  Hace tiempo que no somo un team
  Pal carajo nuestro aniversario y San Valentín
  Ya no hay más Christian Lou ni los traje en satén
  Síguelo que está verde eh
  Que tiene la culpa es lo que te muerde
  Quédate con el perro pa que de mí te acuerde
  Y piense en to lo que te pierde
  
  Puente
  Pero te deseo suerte ahora soy má fuerte
  Gracia a to lo que me hiciste eh
  Tú nunca me quisiste eh
  No sé por qué me insiste
  Pero te deseo suerte ahora soy má fuerte
  Gracia a to lo que me hiciste eh
  Tú nunca me quisiste eh
  No sé por qué me insiste

  `Intro: Big Sean
  Yeah, what happens when it's too good to throw away?
  You either let it go bad or go away
  (I need to pray)
  
  Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign
  Take my time (Part two), take my time, I'ma take my time
  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Look)
  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Uh)
  
  Chorus: Big Sean
  I'm single again (Single again)
  Told her we'll be better off friends (Uh)
  Baby, I should just focus on me (On me)
  And slow down, don't rush romance
  I'm single again (Single again)
  Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
  Blaming you is just so easy (Woah)
  But maybe the problem's me
  I'm single again (Single again)
  Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Gon' be)
  Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
  Maybe I should spend this cash on me (On me)
  
  Verse 1: Big Sean
  Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave (What?)
  Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need (What?)
  Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
  Got me feeling like, "I don't fuck with you"
  Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
  You fucking with the new me (Yeah)
  Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me (Damn near)
  All the trust gone, seems like all you say is, "Prove it to me" (Straight)
  And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me (Don't)
  Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad (Damn)
  Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em back (Uh-huh)
  Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
  Who knows? (Who knows?)
  
  Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Big Sean
  I'm single again (Single again)
  Told her we'll be better off friends (Off friends)
  Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
  And slow down, don't rush romance
  I'm single again (Single again)
  Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
  Blaming you is just so easy (Uh-huh)
  But maybe the problem's me (Straight up)
  I'm single again (Single again)
  Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Yeah, yeah)
  Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
  Maybe I should spend this cash on me
  
  Post-Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko
  Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
  Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
  Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time
  
  Verse 2: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign
  What have you done for yourself?
  What have you done for your mental health? (Yeah, yeah)
  I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
  Short term fix, that breaks everything else (Oh, oh)
  And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
  I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled (Oh)
  He said the major key is to be strong on your own
  Lose your other half, you're never off balance (Oh)
  Lookin' for the love in somebody else
  That I probably should've gave to myself
  Cycles I need to break in myself
  If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so (Yeah)
  
  Chorus: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign
  I'm single again (Oh)
  Told her we'll be better off friends (Better off friends)
  Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
  And slow down, don't rush romance
  I'm single again
  Told 'em that we better off friends (Oh, yeah)
  Blaming you is just so easy (Oh)
  But maybe the problem's me (Ooh)
  I'm single again
  Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Way)
  Maybe I should spend this time on me (Way)
  Maybe I should spend this cash on me (Ooh)
  
  Post-Chorus: Big Sean
  Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
  Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
  Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time
  
  Outro: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign
  Yeah
  Stay on this grind
  (Oh, oh, ayy)
  (Dolla $ign)
  (Oh)`,
  `[Intro: Soyeon & Becky G]
  원하는 게 얼굴에 보여
  I'm trouble and you're wa-wa-wanting it
  Yeah, yeah
  
  [Verse 1: Thutmose]
  Movin' too fast, life is movin' in slow-mo
  I'm a god, better ask if you don't know
  Homie, better put your pride aside (Aside)
  I'm a Benz and you're more like a Volvo
  Your best stuff looks like my worst, synapses fire and burst
  Got the whole crew with me, 'bout to deal damage
  You know we ain't average (Oh yeah)
  I ain't gonna say this again
  But this is my time, better look in my eyes
  I'm a genius in disguise, wear my heart on my sleeve
  And you forced to oblige to a king in his prime (Yeah, yeah)
  Everybody get in line, sit back, watch the stars align
  I finesse like my life on the line
  Was a diamond in the rough and now I shine (Woo)
  
  [Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
  Ay, no one can stop us, they'll try, but they won't
  Ay, nada nos puede parar, oh, no
  
  [Chorus: Keke Palmer]
  We're wide awake now, our eyes are wide open
  We're runnin' this world, we're keepin' it turnin'
  We're livin' like giants, yeah, giants
  We're bigger than giants, we're giants, oh
  
  [Post-Chorus: Becky G]
  Sleepin' giants, sleepin', sleepin' giants (Yah)
  
  [Verse 2: Becky G & Soyeon]
  Shuttin' it down, been underground
  Now my people all up in this place (Place)
  Spinnin' this thing, gold on my ring, royalty up in my veins (Veins)
  I'm loco, think I'm so cold, I stay stuntin', ain't no goin' back
  Now they ask where QiQi's at, I'm like you can't hang with that
  쏟아져 빛이 멀게 돼 눈이
  멈추진 않아 once we go
  날카로운 날로 뭐든 베어
  빨리 달려 넌! 못.따.라. 와~
  True Damage, we do it, True Damage 보여줄게 뭐든 쉽게
  이기든지든, my crew make the beat drop
  
  [Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
  Ay, no one can stop us, they'll try, but they won't (They won't)
  Ay, nada nos puede parar, oh, no
  
  [Chorus: Keke Palmer, Becky G & Both]
  We're wide awake now, our eyes are wide open
  We're runnin' this world, we're keepin' it turnin'
  We're livin' like giants (Yeah), yeah, giants
  We're bigger than giants (Yeah), we're giants
  You thought that we were weak, but we comin' right back (Right back)
  This time, you're gonna see how we do it like that (Yeah)
  We're livin' like giants, yeah, giants (Yeah)
  We're bigger than giants, we're giants, oh
  
  [Post-Chorus: Becky G]
  Sleepin' giants, sleepin', sleepin' giants
  
  [Verse 3: DUCKWRTH, Soyeon & Keke Palmer]
  Mm, I keep on shattering time
  I might just leave you behind
  Homie, you stuck on rewind (Yeah, yeah, yuh)
  You should quit sleepin' on mines (Woo)
  You got your back on recline
  When I damage your delicate spine
  Please don't act all shy and surprised (누구)
  They be like (뭐), they be like
  What you mean? (Uh) What is your winning scheme? (Woo)
  I got a giant team (That's what?), big as my self esteem (Big)
  Run it back, run it back, runnin' man (Run it)
  They think they go hard, I'm like come again (Sheesh)
  You run out of time when I'm bustin' in, while you stumblin'
  I got this blade in my hand for your punishment (Oh, woo)
  
  [Chorus: Keke Palmer, Becky G, Both & Thutmose]
  We're wide awake now, our eyes are wide open
  We're runnin' this world, we're keepin' it turnin'
  We're livin' like giants (Giants), yeah, giants (Yeah)
  We're bigger than giants (Woo), we're giants (Yeah)
  You thought that we were weak, but we comin' right back (Right back)
  This time, you're gonna see how we do it like that (Yeah)
  We're livin' like giants (Giants), yeah, giants (Hey)
  We're bigger than giants (Hey), we're giants, oh
