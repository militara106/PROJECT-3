      Yeah, what happens when it's too good to throw away?
      You either let it go bad or go away
      (I need to pray)

      Take my time (part two), take my time, I'ma take my time
      Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (look)
      Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (uh)

      I'm single again (single again)
      Told 'em we'll be better off friends (uh)
      Maybe I should just focus on me (on me)
      And slow down, don't rush romance
      I'm single again (single again)
      Told 'em that we better off friends (off friends)
      Blaming you is just so easy (whoa)
      But maybe the problem's me
      I'm single again (single again)
      Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (gon' be)
      Maybe I should spend this time on me (on me)
      Maybe I should spend this cash on me (on me)

      Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave (what?)
      Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need (what?)
      Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
      Got me feeling like, "I don't fuck with you"
      Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
      You fucking with the new me (yeah)
      Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me (straight)
      All the trust gone, seems like all you say is "Prove it to me" (straight)
      And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me (don't)
      Maybe 'cause my mama never worked it out with my dad (damn)
      Maybe 'cause she had insecurities and she had 'em bad (uh-huh)
      Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
      Who knows (who knows)
      I'm single again (single again)
      Told her we'll be better off friends (off friends)
      Maybe I should just focus on me (on me)
      And slow down, don't rush romance

      Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

      What have you done for yourself?
      What have you done for your mental health? (Yeah, yeah)
      I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
      Short term fix, that breaks everything else (oh, oh)
      And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
      I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled (oh)
      He said the major key is to be strong on your own
      Lose your other half, you're never off balance (oh)
      Lookin' for the love in somebody else
      That I prolly shoulda gave to myself
      Cycles I need to break in myself
      If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so (yeah)

      I'm single again (oh)
      Told 'em we'll be better off friends (better off friends)
      Maybe I should just focus on me (on me)
